For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.


## ‚ö°Ô∏è Execution Policy for Bolt.new
IMPORTANT: Bolt.new must operate continuously, checking off tasks in the Implementation Checklist without pausing or waiting for instructions. Each completed module or file should immediately trigger the next logical task.

‚úî Behavior Rules
1. No Halting ‚Äî Do not stop after completing a single task. Progress to the next checklist item immediately.

2. Checklist Bound ‚Äî Reference and validate against 02_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md at each step. Only mark a task complete if it meets all specified acceptance criteria.

3. Checklist Completeness ‚Äî The checklist must include:
- All routes/pages and edge functions
- Database schema (all referenced tables and relationships)
- Donation percentage enforcement logic
- Stripe metadata validation
- Crypto donation logic
- RevenueCat & Pica webhook testing
- AI onboarding + OpenAI key support for store managers
- Final success condition: the entire system matches 01_INITIAL.md blueprint

4. Command Escalation ‚Äî When Bolt.new finishes 01_INITIAL.md, it must continue with 03_IMPLEMENTATION_COMMAND.md immediately.

5. Self-checks ‚Äî Every function or module implemented must include:
- Validation logic (e.g., metadata checks, % limits)
- Integration test stubs
- Logging and error recovery (if applicable)

# üß† Strategy for Bolt.new
1. Start with 01_INITIAL.md
- Extract and map all components, functions, endpoints, user flows, and integrations.
- For each, find its corresponding implementation task in 02_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md.
- Mark missing items (e.g., donation validation, crypto donation edge case) and add them.

2. Validate 02_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md
- Confirm every feature and flow mentioned in 01_INITIAL.md is reflected.
- Add missing checklist items (if any) such as:
    - Stripe metadata validation hook
    - Duplicate {product_id + campaign_id} cart logic
    - Donation certificate PDF generation
    - AI Wizard for onboarding
    - Crypto donation verification endpoint

3. Proceed with Development
- Start from the top of the checklist (Foundation ‚Üí Auth ‚Üí Campaigns ‚Üí Checkout).
- After each section:
    - ‚úÖ Validate acceptance criteria
    - üì• Log result
    - Command result in MD file
    - üöÄ Continue to next section without delay

4. Final Phase: 03_IMPLEMENTATION_COMMAND.md
- Begin only after all items from the initial blueprint have been verified and implemented.
- Use this file as the execution logic source (structure, architecture, setup files, commands).
- Confirm Bolt.new has set up all components including Docker, Supabase, Stripe, RevenueCat, and Pica.

üîÅ Reiteration Mechanism
If Bolt.new is restarted or reloaded:
- Resume from last incomplete checklist section.
- Re-validate already completed sections before progressing.
