Thought for 12s
This is a massive implementation blueprint for a full-stack e-commerce and donation platform called Shop2Give. I need to parse through the three attached documents to understand the full scope and implement according to the specifications.

Let me break down what needs to be implemented:

01_INITIAL.md - The main blueprint with user flows, technology stack, and requirements
02_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md - Detailed acceptance criteria and phase-by-phase implementation plan
03_IMPLEMENTATION_COMMAND.md - Specific implementation instructions
From the requirements, I need to implement:

Core Technology Stack:

Frontend: Vite + React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS 3 + Shadcn UI
Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions)
Payments: Stripe + RevenueCat
State Management: Zustand
Auth: Supabase Auth
Multi-language: EN/NL with flag icons
Key Features:

E-commerce platform where purchases support fundraising campaigns
Each product purchase supports one campaign
Cart uses product_id + campaign_id as unique combo
50% default donation percentage
Stripe checkout with metadata
Multi-role system (platform_admin, store_manager, campaign_owner, donor)
Docker setup for local Supabase
Multiple integrations (Pica, Algorand, RevenueCat, etc.)
Critical User Flows:

Sign In/Sign Up with social login
Add to Cart with campaign selection
Stripe checkout with donation processing
Direct donation flow
Campaign/Product CRUD
Dashboard for different roles
UI/Design Requirements:

Brand colors: Pink (#FFF3F1), Teal (#4CBEB6), Charcoal (#1A2C34), etc.

Playfair Display font

Responsive design

3D animations in hero

Bolt.new badge in footer

I'll systematically implement the project, starting with the core foundation and building incrementally. The initial focus will be on setting up the project infrastructure, establishing the tech stack, and creating a solid development environment. This approach ensures a robust and scalable implementation of the Shop2Give platform.

Based on the comprehensive blueprint and implementation checklist, I'll begin implementing the Shop2Give platform systematically. This is a full-stack e-commerce and donation platform where purchases support fundraising campaigns.

Let me start with the foundation and work through the implementation checklist.

npm run dev
I've implemented the foundation of the Shop2Give platform with a comprehensive setup that includes:

Core Features Implemented:

‚úÖ Complete project setup with all required dependencies
‚úÖ Brand styling with custom colors, fonts (Playfair Display), and theme
‚úÖ Responsive navigation with language toggle and cart
‚úÖ Hero section with 3D animations and call-to-action
‚úÖ Instructions section with step-by-step process
‚úÖ Featured campaigns and products sections
‚úÖ Authentication pages (Sign In/Sign Up) with social login placeholders
‚úÖ Campaign listing and detail pages with progress tracking
‚úÖ Product listing and detail pages with campaign selection
‚úÖ Shopping cart page (foundation)
‚úÖ Checkout and success pages (foundation)
‚úÖ Footer with Bolt.new badge and lightning icon as required
Design Elements:

Brand color scheme with pink background (#FFF3F1), teal navigation (#4CBEB6), and charcoal text
Playfair Display font throughout the application
Responsive design with proper breakpoints
Circular progress indicators for campaigns with category-specific colors
3D animations in hero section with floating icons
Gradient backgrounds and smooth transitions
Shadow effects and rounded corners following brand guidelines
Key Technical Components:

TypeScript throughout for type safety
Shadcn UI components with custom brand theming
Framer Motion for animations
React Router for navigation
Utility functions for currency formatting, progress calculation, and cart ID generation
Mock data for campaigns and products to demonstrate functionality
Component structure ready for Supabase and Stripe integration
The application demonstrates the core user flows with a beautiful, production-ready interface. The next phases will implement:

Supabase Database & Edge Functions - Database schema, authentication, and backend functionality
Cart State Management - Zustand implementation with product_id + campaign_id unique combinations
Stripe Integration - Checkout flow with donation processing
Full Authentication - Supabase Auth with role-based access
Admin Dashboards - Management interfaces for different user roles
The foundation is now ready for the full platform implementation following the comprehensive checklist provided.

Integrate stripe into my app

To implement payments in your application, we'll need to use Stripe, which is the industry standard for secure payment processing. Before we can proceed with the integration, you'll need to:

Create a Stripe account if you haven't already
Once logged in, navigate to the Developers section in your Stripe Dashboard
Get your Stripe secret key
Once you have your Stripe secret key, let me know and I'll help you implement a secure payment system in your application.

Add Stripe API Key

I want my application to accept payments for the following products:

Stripe Products

I'll help you create edge functions to handle both Stripe checkout session creation and webhook processing securely. We'll set up two edge functions and update all the necessary code in your application to make everything work together seamlessly:

A checkout endpoint that creates Stripe checkout sessions for product purchases
A webhook endpoint that securely verifies and processes Stripe webhook events
I'll also update the rest of your application code to properly integrate with these edge functions, including the frontend components, API calls, and any required configuration.

Supabase Edge Functions for Stripe
